**What tools were used?**

JavaScript, MongoDB, React, Express, CSS, HTML5.

**What did I learn from this project**

This was an opportunity to use all the JavaScript skills and knowledge I picked up from the previous 4 weeks to create something I could imagine using in the real world. I wanted this app to have a clear user journey and make sure it was easy to use whilst showing off many of the things we learned. Throughout the project, myself and my group wanted to push our knowledge and create functionalities we hadn't necessarily learned to show off what we could do.

**Group or Infidivdual project**

This was a group project, we took an agile approach to this project with myself as the Scrum Master.

**How long did the project take?**Â 
This project was started from scratch and took 6 days in total.
